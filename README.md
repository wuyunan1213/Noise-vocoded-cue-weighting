# Noise-vocoded-cue-weighting code
This file contains code for calculating native English speakers' weight of the two acoustic dimensions in categorizing the vowels SET and SAT. This code was adopted from Ran Liu's R code, which inherits the original cue-weight calculating method in Lotto & Holt's 2006 paper. Note that the "weight" here refers to the beta coefficient in a regression equation.
